# Big Ideas Final

This is a analysis of Pittsburgh neighborhoods in order to determine which neighborhood is the "best". The "best" neighborhood is the one where we are least likely to encounter or be unable to escape from some sort of disaster. The datasets we used are linked below.

## Datasets
- [Fire Incidents](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh) details reported fire incidents in Pittsburgh that were responded to by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire.
- [Speed Humps](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-speed-humps) contains the location and information about each speed hump in the City of Pittsburgh.
- [Water Toxins](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/toxic-release-inventory/resource/c9baaa77-2dc5-494c-a2ce-f90db9106df2) reports of released water toxins by companies and their specific facilities.
